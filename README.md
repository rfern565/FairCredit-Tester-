# FairCredit-Tester-

This was made as a component of a larger project attempting to explore different ways credit score creation can be more equitable.

Description:
A machine learning pipeline for credit score classification using logistic regression. The project preprocesses data, encodes categorical variables, and handles missing values before training a model. It evaluates performance and fairness by analyzing accuracy disparity and demographic parity differences across gender groups.

Data obtained via Kaggle.
